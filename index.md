# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

***

[Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/Senai538/Car-Price-Prediction)

<img src="images/carprediction.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used**:Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Linear Regression, Sklearn

**Project Obective**: In this project I build a linear regression model to predict the price of a car. 

**Quantifiable Results**: I got a 91% accuracy.

- We learn what variables affect the price of a car

[Handwriting Recognition Using Convolution Neural Network](https://github.com/Senai538/Handwriting-Recognition-using-DNN)

<img src="images/Neural-MNIST.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used**:Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Numpy.

**Project Obective**:In this project we will build a deep neural network that will recognize the handwritten text. we are going to use mnist dataset which has 60000 handwritten text samples. we will train our model and check accuracy and if accuracy is not up-to the mark then we will modify our CNN model.

**Quantifiable Results**:We could identify what the correct hand written number is 97% of the time. First I used neutral network with no hidden layer and my accuracy was a little less. After adding the hidden layer my accuracy went up by 2%.

[Apple Stock Prediction Project](https://github.com/Senai538/Apple-Stock-Prediction-)

<img src="images/stock-1.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used**:Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Numpy, Lstm, Time_Step, Neural Network

**Project Obective**: LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. In this Project we used LSTM to predict stock Close prediction. I used timestep to help me do this. 

**Quantifiable Results**:We could predict the stock Close for the day with  89% accuracy.

[Logistic Regression Project](https://github.com/Senai538/Logistic-Regression)

<img src="images/Bank.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used**:Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Logistic Regression

**Project Obective**: The classification goal of this project was to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. I used logistic regression then had to implement SMOTE to deal with the oversampling.

**Quantifiable Results**:We could predict the stock Close for the day with  90% accuracy.
