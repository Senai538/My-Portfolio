# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/Senai538/Linear-Regression-Model-SeoulBike/blob/0771b86207bbc25911e6bcb19f6df77343a07752/Linear_Regression%20Project%20Senai11.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used**:Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Linear Regression, Sklearn
**Project Obective**:
**Quantifiable Results**:
- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/emani27/Emani_DataScience/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used**:
**Project Obective**:
**Quantifiable Results**:
- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](/sample_page)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used**:
**Project Obective**:
**Quantifiable Results**:
- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Handwriting Recognition Using Convolution Neural Network](https://github.com/Senai538/Handwriting-Recognition-using-DNN)

<img src="images/Neural-MNIST.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used**:Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Numpy
**Project Obective**:In this project we will build a deep neural network that will recognize the handwritten text. we are going to use mnist dataset which has 60000 handwritten text samples. we will train our model and check accuracy and if accuracy is not up-to the mark then we will modify our CNN model.
**Quantifiable Results**:We could identify what the correct hand written number is 97% of the time. First I used neutral network with no hidden layer and my accuracy was a little less. After adding the hidden layer my accuracy went up by 2%.
